## A bit of history

Complete Systems, Inc. started in 1982 as a provider of practice management software for dental offices. Eventually the software we developed was expanded to work in many types of practices including psychologists, optometrists, surgeons, obstetricians and family practice physicians.

We saw that many of our clients were frustrated with the solutions available to them for collecting large balances from patients. Since we had already written software to print monthly bank drafts for collection of our own monthly service fees, we offered a draft printing service to our doctors to collect from their patients.

So, in 1998,  Archive-Bank- was born, first as a service bureau to print bank drafts and eventually evolving into the various electronic financial services now offered under the Archive-Bank-  brand.
